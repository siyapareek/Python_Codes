//A variable is like a labeled box where you can store data. Imagine you have a box labeled "age" and you put the number 25 in it. In Python, you would do this by writing age = 25. This means you're storing the number 25 in the variable named age.
//Here's the cool part: whenever you use age in your code, Python will remember it is 25. For example, if you write print(age), Python will show 25.
//Task
//Create a variable in editor named age and assign the value 25 to it.
//Print the value of age variable using print statement.
//Notice how we don't use " " (double quotes) when printing variables.

age = 25
print(age)
